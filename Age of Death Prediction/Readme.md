# Age of Death Prediction 

The project aims at predicting the age of death by using Linear Regression.

### Dataset 
Dataset used can be dowloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/data#) 

### Libraries Involved: 
1. torch
2. torchvision
3. torch.nn
4. pandas
5. matplotlib.pyplot
6. seaborn
7. torch.nn.functional
8. pickle

### Steps Involved:
1. Downloading the data
2. Cleaning the data
3. Data Analysis 
4. Data Loaders
5. Model Creation
6. Model Training

There are 2 folders:
1. Dataset folder consists of Data and a read me file which mentions the source of data.
2. Model folder contains a Jupyter notebook explaining everything in detail. It can be run in Anaconda. The folder also contains the pkl file of the models implemented in the jupyter notebook.

### Conclusion: 
A model capable of predicting the age of death has been trained which results in reduction of validation losses to the value of 6.2689.
