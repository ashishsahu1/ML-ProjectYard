# Clean-or-Messy Room Classifier
This project aims at building a classifier that can classify between a clean and a messy room.

# Dataset used
The dataset that was used to build this project was taken from Kaggle. The data set contains about 100 images of both clean and messy room and is comparitively small as compared to other data sets that we use for performing any deep learninng task.

# Results
The model in the end gave decent results. With validation accuracy of 95% and training accuracy of 98%, the model could have been better if we had a little bit more data. More data always helps in training better models.
