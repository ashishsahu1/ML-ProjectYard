# Dataset

Every year Kaggle conducts a survey for the users of the platform and they take feedbacks on various things from the users of the platform. They compile it together to create an annual competition of Kaggle Survey which demands the people to carry out extensive EDA on the data in order to gain insights from the data. The data set was too big to include so i have added the link to the data set which people can use to enhance their EDA skills.
