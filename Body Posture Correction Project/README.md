## Body Posture Correction Project

A project created using Tensorflow.JS, Posenet, ML5.JS, P5.JS which tracks the body posture of the user and in case the posture is wrong, then it blurs the screen of the user and also sends an alarm sound.
On leaning backwards or sidewards, the screen blurs out and an alarm is set off.
