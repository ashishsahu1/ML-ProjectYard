# 📈 STARTUP PROFIT PREDICTION

## Aim

The aim is to predict profit that a startup will make on the basis of their R&D, Administration, Marketing Spend and State where they are based in the US.

## ML Algorithm Used

Decision Tree Regression

Decision Tree is a decision-making tool that uses a flowchart-like tree structure or is a model of decisions and all of their possible results, including outcomes, input costs and utility.

Decision-tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning algorithms. It works for both continuous as well as categorical output variables.

Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to produce meaningful continuous output. Continuous output means that the output/result is not discrete, i.e., it is not represented just by a discrete, known set of numbers or values.
