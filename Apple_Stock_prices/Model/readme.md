The model takes the input of the 'Apple' company stock prices and outputs the prediction of the Closing price of the stock. 

It is implemented on Python using Linear Regression Models.Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.

**Linear Regression Pros**:
- Simple to implement.
- Overfitting can be reduced by regularization
- Used to predict numeric values.
- Performance on linearly seperable datasets

**Linear Regression Cons**:
- Prone to overfitting.
- Sensitive to outliers
- Cannot be used when the relation between independent and dependent variable are non linear.
