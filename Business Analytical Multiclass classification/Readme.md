# Multi class classification on Business analytics Datasets

## About Project

This project involves classification of more than two classes. A machine learning model has been built for bussiness prospective to classifies arguments about the mental health challenges that a person struggle with. The four categories are depression, suicide, alchoholism, and drug abuse.


## Dataset 

Dataset folder consists of 3 files: 
`Train.csv` - has the unique ID of each statement along with the label. You will use this file to train your model on.

`Test.csv` - has the unique IDs you will be testing your model on.

`SampleSubmission.csv` - is an example of what your submission file should look like. The order of the rows does not matter, but the order of the columns (Depression, Alcohol, Suicide, Drugs) must be the same as the sample submission. Your submission should contain probabilities that the ID is of each category (with values between 0 and 1 inclusive). The values across the columns do not have to add up to 1.

The dataset used is obtained from Tech4MentalHealth 


## Working Model:
The working model is metioned in the Jupyter notebook explaining everything in detail.
